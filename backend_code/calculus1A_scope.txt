Scope: Permitted Knowledge for Evaluation

The model may reference and verify only the following topics from Calculus 1A:

1. Foundations & Sets
- Set theory: union, intersection, complement, disjoint sets, set difference  
- Cartesian products and ordered pairs  
- Binary and equivalence relations  
- Functions: domain, range, injective/surjective/bijective/inverse  
- Sequences as functions, graphs of functions  

2. Number Systems
- Definitions and properties of:
  - Natural numbers (ℕ)  
  - Integers (ℤ)  
  - Rational numbers (ℚ)  
  - Real numbers (ℝ)  
  - Complex numbers (ℂ)  
- Peano axioms and mathematical induction  
- Rational numbers via equivalence classes  
- Countable and uncountable sets  
- Cantor’s diagonal argument  

3. Algebraic Structures
- Fields and field axioms for addition and multiplication  
- Ordered fields and absolute value  
- Field extensions: ℚ(√a), ℚ(√−1)  
- Archimedean property  

4. Real Numbers (ℝ)
- Least upper bound (supremum) and greatest lower bound (infimum)  
- Dedekind cuts and construction of real numbers  
- Completeness of ℝ as an ordered field  
- Decimal representation of real numbers  
- Density of ℚ in ℝ  

5. Order & Intervals
- Open, closed, half-open intervals  
- Linearly ordered sets  
- Bounded sets: upper/lower bounds, max/min, sup/inf  

6. Summation & Products
- Sigma (Σ) and Pi (Π) notation for finite sets and indexed families  
- Associativity, commutativity, distributivity in finite sums/products  
- Reordering and variable substitution in sums  

7. Roots & Inequalities
- Existence and uniqueness of real nth roots  
- Bernoulli’s inequality  

8. Complex Numbers
- Complex numbers defined as ℝ(√−1) = {x + iy}  
- Operations in ℂ: addition, multiplication, conjugate, absolute value  
- Real and imaginary parts
